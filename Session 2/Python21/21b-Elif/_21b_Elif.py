"""
You are designing a decision structure to convert a student's numeric grade to a letter 
grade. The program must assign a letter grade as specified in the following:

if the user enters a 90 through 100, the output should be, "Your letter grade is A". 
Likewise, if a user enters an 80 through 89, the output should be "Your letter grade is B".
if a user enters an 70 through 79, the outpu should be "your letter grade is C"
if a user enters an 65 through 69, the outpu should be "your letter grade is D"



How should you complete the code?

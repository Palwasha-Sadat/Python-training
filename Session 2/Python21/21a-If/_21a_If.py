# Exercise description
"""
Exercise:

You are coding a math utility by using Python.
You are writing a function to compute roots.
The function must meet the following requirements:

- If 'a' is non-negative, return 'a**(1/b)' (a to the power of 1/b).
- If 'a' is negative and even, return "result is an imaginary number."
- If 'a' is negative and odd, return '-(-a)**(1/b)' (the negative square root of -a to the power of 1/b).

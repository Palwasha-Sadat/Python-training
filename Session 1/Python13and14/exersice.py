You are writing a Python program that evaluates an arithmetic formula.
The formula is described as b equals a multiplied by negative one, then raised to the second power,
 where a is the value that will be input and b is the result.
You create the following code segment. Line numbers are included for reference only.

a = float(input("enter a number for equation: "))
b = ?
